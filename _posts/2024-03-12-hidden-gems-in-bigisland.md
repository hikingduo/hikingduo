If you're looking to explore beyond the beaten path and uncover the island's best-kept secrets, here are some hidden gems you won't want to miss.

### 1. Papakolea Beach (Green Sand Beach)
Located on the southern tip of the island near South Point, Papakolea Beach is one of only four green sand beaches in the world. Its unique olive-green sands are formed by the erosion of the nearby Pu'u Mahana cinder cone. While reaching the beach requires a hike across rugged terrain, the breathtaking views and secluded atmosphere make it well worth the effort.

### 2. Waipi'o Valley
Tucked away on the northeast coast of the island, Waipi'o Valley is a lush and remote valley known as the "Valley of the Kings." Accessible only by a steep and winding road or by hiking, this hidden gem offers stunning vistas of verdant cliffs, cascading waterfalls, and taro fields. Take a guided horseback ride or hike down to the valley floor for an unforgettable adventure.

### 3. Puako Petroglyph Archaeological Preserve
Situated on the Kohala Coast, the Puako Petroglyph Archaeological Preserve is home to one of the largest collections of ancient petroglyphs in Hawaii.

Take a self-guided tour along the preserve's trails to discover these ancient treasures.

### 4. Pololu Valley
Located at the northern tip of the island, Pololu Valley is a remote and rugged paradise known for its dramatic cliffs, black sand beach, and lush valley floor. Hike down the steep trail from the lookout point to reach the beach below, where you can soak in the stunning scenery and cool off in the clear waters of the Pacific Ocean.

### 6. Pu'u Huluhulu
For panoramic views of the island's volcanic landscapes, head to Pu'u Huluhulu, a volcanic cinder cone located in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. The moderate hike to the summit offers sweeping vistas of Mauna Loa, Mauna Kea, and Kilauea volcanoes, as well as the surrounding lava fields and forests. Be sure to bring plenty of water and sturdy hiking shoes for this adventure.
