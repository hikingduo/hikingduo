International travel opens up a world of adventure and discovery, but it can also come with unexpected costs, such as foreign transaction fees imposed by credit card companies when you make purchases abroad. These fees can add up quickly, eating into your travel budget. However, with the right credit card, you can avoid these fees altogether, allowing you to make purchases abroad without worrying about extra charges. In this guide, we'll explore some of the best no annula fee credit cards for international travelers looking to bypass foreign transaction fees and make the most of their journeys.

### Understanding Foreign Transaction Fees:
Foreign transaction fees are charges imposed by credit card issuers when you make purchases in a foreign currency. These fees typically range from 1% to 3% of the transaction amount and are applied to each purchase made outside your home country. For example, if you use a credit card with a 3% foreign transaction fee to make a $1000 purchase while traveling abroad, you'll incur an additional $30 fee.
