Hawaii's Big Island, also known as the Island of Hawaii, is a captivating destination renowned for its diverse landscapes, from lush rainforests and dramatic waterfalls to rugged coastlines and volcanic landscapes. Here are some must-see places to explore during your visit to the Big Island:

### Hawaii Volcanoes National Park
No trip to the Big Island is complete without a visit to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Home to two of the world's most active volcanoes, Kilauea and Mauna Loa, the park offers visitors the opportunity to witness the raw power of volcanic activity up close. Explore lava tubes, hike through lush rainforests, and marvel at the otherworldly landscapes shaped by volcanic eruptions.

### Akaka Falls State Park
Located just north of Hilo, Akaka Falls State Park is home to one of the island's most iconic waterfalls. A short walk through lush rainforest foliage leads visitors to Akaka Falls, a stunning 442-foot cascade plunging into a gorge below. Be sure to explore the park's other scenic trails and lookout points offering panoramic views of the surrounding landscape.

### Waipio Valley
Known as the "Valley of the Kings," Waipio Valley is a lush and verdant valley on the northeastern coast of the Big Island. Accessible by 4WD vehicle, hiking, or horseback riding, the valley is home to stunning black sand beaches, taro fields, and towering cliffs. Take a guided tour or hike down into the valley to explore its natural beauty and learn about its rich history and cultural significance.

### Mauna Kea Summit
Standing at over 13,000 feet above sea level, Mauna Kea is the highest peak in Hawaii and one of the best places in the world for stargazing. Visitors can drive to the summit to enjoy panoramic views of the island and observe the night sky from one of the world-class observatories located at the summit. Be sure to dress warmly, as temperatures at the summit can be quite cold, especially after sunset.

### Pu'uhonua o Honaunau National Historical Park
Step back in time and explore the rich cultural heritage of Hawaii at Pu'uhonua o Honaunau National Historical Park. This sacred site served as a place of refuge for ancient Hawaiians who broke sacred laws, offering them a chance for redemption and forgiveness. Explore the park's archaeological sites, reconstructed temples, and pristine beaches while learning about Hawaiian history and culture.

For sun-seekers and beach lovers, Hapuna Beach State Recreation Area is a must-visit destination on the Big Island.

Spend the day lounging on the beach, playing in the waves, or exploring the nearby tide pools.
