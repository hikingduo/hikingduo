However, with an annual fee of $695, many potential cardholders may question whether the benefits justify the cost. Let's delve into the details of the American Express Platinum Card and assess whether it's worth the investment.

At first glance, the $695 annual fee may seem daunting. However, when you consider the extensive list of benefits that come with the American Express Platinum Card, the fee begins to make more sense. We got our amex platinum card 3 years ago and we definetely love its benefits. 

### Up to $200 Annual Airline Fee Credit

The American Express Platinum Card offers up to $200 in annual airline fee credits, which can be used for incidental fees like baggage fees, in-flight purchases, and more. This credit alone can significantly offset the annual fee for frequent flyers.

### Up to $200 Annual Hotel Credit

Cardholders receive up to $200 in annual credits for eligible prepaid hotel bookings made through Amex Travel. This benefit is particularly valuable for travelers who frequently book accommodations through Amex's extensive network of luxury hotels. 

### Up to $200 Annual Uber Credits

Another perk of the American Express Platinum Card is up to $200 in annual Uber credits, which can be used for rides or Uber Eats orders in the U.S. This benefit is a great way to save on transportation costs during your travels.

### Up to $240 Digital Entertainment Credits

New to the American Express Platinum Card is up to $240 in annual credits for digital entertainment services, including purchases or subscriptions to select streaming platforms. This addition enhances the card's value proposition, especially for those who enjoy streaming content.

### Gold Membership with Hilton and Marriott

Cardholders receive complimentary gold elite status with both Hilton Honors and Marriott Bonvoy, providing access to room upgrades, late checkout, and other exclusive perks at participating properties.

### Amazing Lounge Collection

One of the most cherished benefits of the American Express Platinum Card is access to the Global Lounge Collection, which includes Centurion Lounges, Priority Pass lounges, Delta Sky Clubs, and more. Lounge access can greatly enhance the travel experience by providing a comfortable space to relax and unwind before or between flights. Do you know <a href="https://global.americanexpress.com/lounge-access/the-platinum-card/JFK/The-Centurion-Lounge-Terminal-4-ErTeaB28Ky"><b style="color: blue;">Amex Centurion Lounge New York (JFK)</b></a> offers free massages to its members?

We got our Amex Platinum Card three years ago and have been thoroughly enjoying its benefits ever since. As avid travelers, we hate waiting at the gate for our flights and prefer spending our time in airport lounges. American Express boasts some of the best lounges with amazing food and drinks. Our personal favorites are the Plaza Premium Lounges in Dubai and Malaysia.

### Purchase Protection and Phone Protection

The American Express Platinum Card offers robust purchase protection, which covers eligible purchases against accidental damage or theft for up to 90 days from the date of purchase. Additionally, cardholders can enjoy complimentary cell phone protection, providing coverage for damage or theft of their cell phone when the monthly phone bill is paid with the card. This benefit proved to be a lifesaver during our snorkeling adventure in Hawaii. Unfortunately, our phone got wet and stopped working. However, thanks to the comprehensive coverage provided by Amex, we were able to file a claim and receive reimbursement.


### Amex Fine Hotels and Collections Perks

Cardholders can enjoy exclusive perks and benefits when booking stays at select Fine Hotels and Resorts properties through American Express Travel. These perks may include room upgrades, complimentary breakfast, late checkout, and more, enhancing the luxury travel experience. We've taken advantage of the this perk by booking the [luxurious Taj Mahal Hotel in Delhi](https://www.tajhotels.com/en-in/taj/taj-mahal-new-delhi/) through Amex fine hotels & collection. Not only did we receive the hotel credit back, but we also enjoyed a $100 experience credit, which we used for a sumptuous dinner at the hotel. Additionally, the early check-in and late checkout options have been incredibly convenient during our travels

## Conclusion: Is It Worth It?

Traveling is more than just reaching a destination; it's about the journey and the experiences along the way. As avid travelers Saurabh and I have always sought ways to enhance our adventures and make each trip memorable. Four years ago, we decided to take our travel game to the next level by getting the American Express Platinum Card. Today, we can confidently say that it has transformed the way we explore the world.

While the $695 annual fee of the American Express Platinum Card may seem steep, the extensive list of benefits and perks more than justifies the cost for frequent travelers and luxury enthusiasts. From airline and hotel credits to lounge access and elite status perks, the American Express Platinum Card offers unparalleled value and convenience for those who prioritize travel and luxury experiences. If you're someone who travels frequently and takes advantage of the card's benefits, the high annual fee is undoubtedly worth it.

In conclusion, the American Express Platinum Card is not just a credit card â€“ it's a gateway to a world of luxury travel and exclusive perks. If you're ready to elevate your travel experience and enjoy VIP treatment wherever you go, the American Express Platinum Card is worth every penny of its annual fee.
